## New Features

*   **Enhanced Easy Template:** The "Easy" template now supports all `ld` (load) and `st` (store) instructions, offering greater assistance for cheat creation.

*   **Customizable Button Layout:**
    *   You can now rearrange buttons to your liking.
    *   The "Focus Mode" toggle key now opens the "Focus Manager".
    *   Enable "Focus Edit" mode within the Focus Manager to start rearranging.
    *   Use the `FocusMode_Erase` key to add a button to a temporary stack. This key still functions to remove the button from the focus menu.
    *   Press `ZR` + `+` to insert the last removed button from the stack, shifting existing buttons down.
