### 3. Troubleshooting: No Cheats Found?

If no cheats appear automatically, try these steps in order.

#### Method 1: Download the Community Cheat Database

2.  Select **Check for Cheat Database Update**, then **Install Cheat Database Update**.
3.  Navigate to the **Cheat Menu**.
4.  Press **Load from DB** to load cheats from the database.

#### Method 2: Manual Installation

If the database has no cheats for your game, you can install cheat files manually. You will need to find a cheat file matching your game's **Title ID** and **Build ID**.
