# Breeze: Quick Start Guide

This guide will get you up and running with Breeze, covering the most common use case: loading and using existing cheats.

## Step 1: Installation

1.  Download the latest `Breeze.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/tomvita/Breeze-Beta/releases).
2.  Copy the contents of the `.zip` file to the root of your SD card.

## Step 2: Launching Breeze

1.  Start the game you want to use cheats with.
2.  From the Switch's HOME Menu, open the **hbmenu** (Album).
3.  Launch **Breeze**.
4.  To return to your game, press the **Home** button twice.

> **Pro-Tip**: For faster access, go to **Settings > Profile shortcut** in Breeze and enable it. You can then launch Breeze directly from your game by pressing **Home -> Up -> A**.

## Step 3: Loading and Using Cheats

Breeze makes it easy to find and apply cheats.

1.  From the Main Menu, select either **Cheats** (for the simple menu) or **Cheat Menu** (for the advanced menu).
2.  Upon entering a cheat menu, Breeze will automatically search for cheats for your running game from its online database.
3.  If cheats are found, they will be displayed in a list.
4.  Use the D-Pad or Left Stick to navigate the list.
5.  Press `X` to **Toggle Cheat** on or off. A solid square (`â– `) means the cheat is active.

That's it! The cheat is now running.

## What If No Cheats Are Found?

If Breeze doesn't find cheats automatically, you can download the community cheat database:
1.  From the Main Menu, go to the **Download** menu.
2.  Select **Check for Cheat Database Update**, then **Install Cheat Database Update**.
3.  Go to the **[Advance Cheat Menu](docs/menu.md#advance-cheat-menu)**.
4.  Press **Load from DB** to load the cheats for your game from the database you just installed.

## Still No Cheats? Manual Installation

If the above methods fail, you can always find and install cheat files manually from the internet. You will need to find the correct cheat file for your game's Title ID and Build ID.

For detailed instructions on file paths and how to find your game's IDs, please refer to the **[Manual Cheat Files](Breeze.md#manual-cheat-files)** section in our main User Manual.

## Basic Customization

Want to change a cheat?
- From the `Simple Cheat Menu`, press `ZL` to go to the **[Advance Cheat Menu](docs/menu.md#advance-cheat-menu)**.
- Here you can:
    - **Edit Cheat**: Change its name or the value it uses.
    - **Add conditional key**: Make a cheat activate only when you press a specific button combo.

## Creating Your Own Cheats

Feeling adventurous? Creating your own cheats from scratch is a powerful feature of Breeze. The process involves searching for memory values, identifying the correct address, and creating a cheat to modify it.
