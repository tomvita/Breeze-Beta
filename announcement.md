# Announcing a Major Documentation Overhaul!

Hello Breeze Community,

To make Breeze easier to use for everyone, from first-time users to seasoned cheat developers, I have completely reorganized and rewritten my documentation.

My goal was to create a clearer, more logical structure that helps you find the information you need quickly and efficiently.

## What's New?

The project's documentation is now built around a central hub:

-   **[The New README.md](README.md)**: This is the best place to start. It provides a high-level overview of Breeze and contains a full, organized list of links to all other guides and technical references.

From the README, you can easily navigate to:
-   A brand new **[Quick Start Guide](quick_start.md)** to get up and running in minutes.
-   A comprehensive **[User Manual](Breeze.md)** that covers every feature in detail.
-   A **[Basic Cheat Making Tutorial](basic_cheat_making_tutorial.md)** for those ready to create their own cheats.
-   Deep technical references for the **[UI Menus](docs/menu.md)** and **[CheatVM](docs/cheats.md)**, now neatly organized in a `docs` folder.

I have put a great deal of effort into making these documents accurate, clear, and helpful, incorporating extensive feedback throughout the process.

I invite you to check out the new documentation structure, starting with the main **[README.md](README.md)**. Your feedback is always welcome as I continue to improve Breeze.

Thank you for your support!
