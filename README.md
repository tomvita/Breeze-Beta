# Breeze
A Nintendo Switch game cheating tool designed to work seamlessly with Atmosphere's cheatVM.

This project started as a rewrite of the features implemented in EdiZon SE. Over time, the code for EdiZon SE became increasingly difficult to maintain, and its UI posed challenges for many users. Over time, numerous features were added, along with significant optimizations, making Breeze much faster and far more powerful than EdiZon SE.

## Objectives
1.  **Improve the User Interface**: Ensure more users can access and enjoy the toolâ€™s features.
2.  **Streamline Codebase**: Make the code easier to develop and extend.
3.  **Leverage Experience**: Apply lessons learned from SE tools to create a robust foundation for future development.
4.  **All in one tool**: Every task involved in cheat creations can be perform with Breeze alone on Switch.
